# DPpackage

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A fork from the ddpanova R package, which currently cannot be installed. The link to the original package is: https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/pmueller/prog.html#anovaddp

The only changes made were to fix some compilation issues in the C source code.

## Installation

You may install ddpanova using the github installer provided in the package `devtools` via:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("konkam/ddpanova")
```

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(DPpackage) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
